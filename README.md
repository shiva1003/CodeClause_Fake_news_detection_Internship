# PROJECT-1_FAKE_NEWS_DETECTION
task-1 for internship of codeclause
In this modern world, data is very important and by the 2020 year, 1.7 megaBytes data generated per second.
So there are many technologies that change the world by this large amount of data.
Machine learning is one of them and we are using this technology to detect fake news.
Fake news's simple meaning is to incorporate information that leads people to the wrong path.
Nowadays fake news spreading like water and people share this information without verifying it.
This is often done to further or impose certain ideas and is often achieved with political agendas.

You can find many datasets for fake news detection on Kaggle or many other sites.
I download these datasets from Kaggle. There are two datasets one for fake news and one for true news.
In-text preprocess we are cleaning our text by steaming, lemmatization, remove stopwords, remove special symbols and numbers, etc.
After cleaning the data we have to feed this text data into a vectorizer which will convert this text data into numerical features.
